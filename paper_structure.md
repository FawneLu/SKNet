The structure of system paper:
- Abstract  
Background: One to two sentences to conclude the background of the research and in which field we want to move on.  
Results: Three to four sentences to conclude what we have done, which kind of problem can we solve and the result we receive.  
Conclusions: One to two sentences to conclude the performance of our research.  

- Background  
The authors compared the features of two different data in the first paragraph. In second paragraph, they gave abundant examples of Biomedical Images that have been widely used.Finally, they discussed the limitation of previous system, described the superior performance of pyHIVE ,and expressed the prospective for the future of this system.
  
- Materials and Methods  
Dataset Details: Introduced the source of data and how we used it.
Workflow and Code: Introduce the overall logic of the system (can be assited by a flow chart), and throughly explained how it works.
-Implementation: Introduce the main algortithms of the system and their implementation process. Meanwhile, mentioned that pyHIVE support Parallelized calculation except Windows version.
Extensive Support: Described that the system is highly user-friendly on several aspects, such as supports multiple input file formats. 

- Results  
Described the  performance of the system working on the dataset, and made the evaluation which was assisted with forms and charts.   

- Discussion  
Discussed the algorithms, acceptance of input format,and parallelization performance of this system.

- Conclusion  
Mentioned that this system has significant impact on biomedical image research studies.
